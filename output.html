<!doctype html><html><head></head><body><h1>The demo</h1><h2>Basics</h2><h3>Syntax</h3><p>The only reserved character are <code>[]</code> square brackets escaped by  doubling them like so <code>[[</code>. Everything revolves around "commands"  inside these brackets. If the commands need some parameters, these are ended  with a terminator - an empty pair of brackets: <code>[]</code>. </p><p>Here are some examples: </p><p><code>[line]</code> - This a <code>line</code> command with no parameters.<br> <code>[b]param1[]</code> - This is an <code>b</code> command with one parameter.<br> <code>[h]1[]text[]</code> - This is an <code>h</code> command with two parameters.<br> </p><h3>Text flow</h3><p>The text flow is similar to markdown in that single line breaks are  insignificant and a double or more line break separates two paragraphs. In fact  all text is separated into paragraphs, unless some commands change that  behavior. More than two line breaks in a row technically create more  paragraphs, but all empty paragraphs are automatically removed. You can learn  more about influencing text flow in the description of commands such as <code>[pend]</code> or <code>[br]</code>. </p><h2>Standard html stuff</h2><h3>bold, italics and code</h3><p>The <code>[b]</code> and <code>[i]</code> commands are what anyone would expect from html  itself. The <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> element has been renamed to <code>[ic]</code> for personal  convenience as I use it a lot. </p><p>Example: <code>[b]bold [i]bold italics[][] [ic]code [b]bold  code[][]</code> - <b>bold <i>bold italics</i></b> <code>code <b>bold code</b></code> </p></body></html>
