# VBML convert

VB's own Markup Language is a simple html generator woth the potential for some
extensibility. I wrote it, because I wanted to make myself a simple way to take
notes in a flexible way.

But enough markdown for now, see demo.html for more. The source for this file is
in examples/00-demo.vbml
